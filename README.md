**User Story:**
  I'm tired of playing solo games! As a gamer, I want a website where I will be able to easily find a gaming teammate of my skill level and playstyle, so that I can have a more enjoyable gaming experience.
  I open up the Onyx Gaming website and land on a page that asks me what game I wish to play. I also have an option to add a game to the database if I do not see it listed as an option. Once I select the game I want to play, I navigate to the find page and the website searches through its database to find a another gamer seeking a teammate for that same game.
  The website then begins showing me potential teammates one at a time, with general information about the player. When I find a gamer that I like, I click the checkmark to send a notification to that gamer. They will receive the notification and have the option to accept or decline my request.
  If the gamer accepts my request, we are matched up and taken to a chat room where we can discuss our expectations before starting the game. We can talk about the game mode, our playing styles, and any other relevant information.
  Once we are both satisfied, we can start gaming together. Thank you Onyx Gaming.
